# Discord Auto Reaction Bot

This bot simply reacts to every message with a given emoji. It's not very useful, but it's a good starting point for a more complex bot.

Simply rename config.json.example to config.json and place your token & emoji in the config. When running, the bot will react with this emoji to every message.
